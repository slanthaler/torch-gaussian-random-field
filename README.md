# torch-gaussian-random-field

Implementation of Gaussian random field sampler in pytorch.

* The standalone file `grf.py` implements Gaussian random field generators in one and two spatial dimensions, based on the Fourier basis and with periodic boundary conditions.
* The jupyter notebook `GaussianRandomField.ipynb` provides an overview of Gaussian random fields.
